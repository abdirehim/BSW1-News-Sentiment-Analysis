### Observations

- The correlation coefficient of ~0 suggests no strong relationship.
- This may be due to:
  - News publication timing (before/after market hours)
  - Low sensitivity of TextBlob to financial language
  - Other external market drivers
- A domain-specific model like FinBERT could be more effective.
